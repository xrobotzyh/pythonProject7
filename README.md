## Introduction
A client needs a program to determine the stocks to buy in order to maximize the clients' profits over a two-year period, while respecting the following constraints:
1.Each stock can only be purchased once.
2.It is not possible to buy a fraction of a stock.
3.The maximum budget per client is 500 euros.

## Quick start
